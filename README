GDocs Presentation Preview Switcher
================================================================================

A little hack put together for a friend, mostly because it was easy
and I wanted to hack around with chrome extensions before I started
something really ambitious


USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, find the extensions portion of the settings page by either:
 - Wrench -> Settings -> Extensions
 - chrome://settings/extensions

Then either:
 - use the packaged extension (not done yet)
 OR
 - Load unpacked extension, and navigate to this directory

Then when in a google docs presentation, there will be an icon in the
url bar:
 - clicking it will disappear the preview pane
 - clicking it again will appear the preview pane

This is suboptimal, because you have to resize the window or speaker
notes to resize the slide itself. This isn't a likely TODO, because we
can't hook into the google code from an extension.

Tested with Chromium 18.0.1025.168
